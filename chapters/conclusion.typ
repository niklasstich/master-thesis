= Conclusion
In this thesis, we explored the definition of aspect-oriented programming, how common software design patterns often address the cross-cutting concerns that AOP tries to build solutions for and the feasibility of using several metaprogramming technologies that facilitate code generation for the task of automatically generating the implementation to several of these commonly used software design patterns. With the Moyou library, which implements the Memento, Singleton, Unsaved Changes and Factory patterns, we have shown that it is entirely possible to use Metalama to generate useful patterns automatically with minimum user input whilst providing users the ability to customize the implementation of the patterns that are thoroughly tested for their correctness, and have provided a starting point for future development efforts of other patterns.

Throughout implementing the Moyou library, we have proven that aspect-oriented programming, and more specifically Metalama, is a useful tool for abstracting out cross-cutting concerns from our applications business logic. We've demonstrated that this approach can increase our code reusability, as we only need a single aspect implementation for all occurrences of a pattern in our code base, and how we improved our adherence to the SRP by moving the logic that addresses these cross-cutting concerns into our aspects instead. Furthermore, we've discussed the fact that this separation between compile-time and run-time code can actually improve testability of our code and reduce the amount of manual tests we have to write for our codebase, as we can ensure that aspects generate the correct code by writing compile-time tests. In addition to that, we've shown that the use of aspects improves the maintainability and readability of our code base by hiding repetitive code that is often unrelated to business logic from the programmer.

However, we have also discussed several downsides and challenges of using AOP for pattern implementation. One major downside inherent to the solution we use is that code is hidden from the user. This is insofar useful as the developer need not concern themselves with the implementation details of the patterns they use to a certain extent, but potentially problematic in case we need to debug the code the aspects generate or, even worse, debug the aspect code that generates our pattern code. This problem is exacerbated the more types are affected by a pattern, as we discussed in the factory and abstract factory example. Using technologies like Metalama for AOP therefore represents a major barrier to entry as the learning curve for a developer who is new to a codebase increases. We also run the risk of vendor lock-in and being unable to customize implementation of patterns in specific circumstances, which is partially mitigated by the Metalama feature of divorcing. It must also be mentioned that due to the nature of Metalama being a commercial product that requires a paid license to use in most cases, the usefulness of the Moyou library to some open-source or even closed-source developers might be limited. As mentioned, not every pattern is a perfect fit for AOP either, as some of them don't really address cross-cutting concerns like the factory or command pattern examples, so the usage for AOP for implementing them must be well thought out.

We have also explored several points of potential improvements to the Moyou library such as implementing new patterns like Command, Observer or Adapter and improving the existing implementations of patterns by taking more care towards potential performance impacts, more flexible choices of implementation strategies or verifying correct usage of our patterns via the use of Metalama fabrics.

In summary, we have demonstrated that source code generation packages like Moyou which are implemented using aspect-oriented programming tools like Metalama can offer a powerful means of automating repetitive grunt work developers do daily by taking over the task of implementing common design patterns and addressing cross-cutting concerns. While there are definitely challenges to overcome, the usage of AOP can support us immensely in face of the task of developing and maintaining code bases of evergrowing complexity.
