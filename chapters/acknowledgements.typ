I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to Prof. Dr. Georg Hagel, who has acted as a respected teacher during my studies at the University of Applied Sciences Kempten, as my superior during my position at the same, and who has helped me in both a professional and personal capacity as the supervisor of this thesis. Without his encouragement, his insistence on keeping me going and the opportunity he offered to me three years ago to work on his research project I probably would have dropped out at some point and never completed my master's program.

Special thanks should also go to Gael Fraiteur and his entire Metalama team who have graciously provided a free license for their commercial product for this thesis and have always answered my many technical questions with great care and kindness, even going so far as to implement a new feature I have wished for during the development of my project.

I want to also extend my gratitude to all my friends, coworkers and acquaintances who have assisted me during this thesis by giving me advice, encouragement and proofreading.

Lastly, I'd like to acknowledge my parents for always supporting me during my studies, both emotionally and financially, never letting up on reminding me that they believe in me and are proud of my accomplishments so far.
