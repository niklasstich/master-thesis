I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to Prof. Dr. Georg Hagel, who has acted as a respected teacher during my studies at the University of Applied Sciences Kempten, as my superior during my position at the same, and who has helped me, both in professional and personal capacity, as the supervisor of this thesis. Without his encouragement and the opportunity he offered to me three years ago to work on his research project I probably would at some point have dropped out and never have finished my masters program.

Special thanks should also go to Gael Fraiteur and his entire Metalama team who have graciously provided a free licence for their commercial product for this thesis and have always answered my many technical questions with great care and kindness, even going so far as to implement a new feature I have wished for during the development of my project.

Lastly, I'd like to acknowledge my parents for always supporting me during my studies, both emotionally and financially, never letting up about reminding me that they believe in me and are proud of my accomplishments so far.
